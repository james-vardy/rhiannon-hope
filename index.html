          <h3>About the EP</h3>
          <p>
            Weaving odes to jazz greats into tales of the working class
            experience and stitching gentle twangs into accordion hums,
            <em>All Things, Rising and Returning</em> marks the debut release
            from Leeds-based folk artist Rhiannon Hope. The EP nurtures a unique
            blend of traditional folk and contemporary influences, with Rhiannon
            looking to the likes of Ella Fitzgerald and Aldous Harding for sonic
            guidance.
          </p>

          <p>
            The resulting sound is at once delicate and deliberate, wistful yet
            soulful, and, perhaps most of all, timeless.
          </p>

          <h3>Lead single 'B.B.' arrives 4th September</h3>
          <p>
            Lead single 'B.B' shows off Hope's talent for melody and intimacy in
            her approach to folk. Softly-picked strings form a tapestry of sound
            around Hope's enchanting harmonies, as she examines her place in the
            world.
          </p>

          <div class="quote">
            B.B., at its core, is about imposter syndrome, yet simultaneously
            being welcomed with open arms, and not knowing how to compute these
            two very strong emotions - it's about feeling very different and
            being very aware of that. Perhaps it is a form of self-soothing, of
            reassurance for myself.

          <p>
            On the eponymous track, Hope pairs her strong, swirling vocals with
            the gentle whirrs of an accordion, evoking all the ethereality of
            the release title, while 'Indulge' builds upon the beauty of 'B.B.'
            with playful plucks and strengthened vocal prowess. Physical copies
            of the EP will feature a bonus track, a live recording of
            'Toothpaste' recorded at Hyde Park Book Club in Leeds, as well as
            artwork created by Rhiannon herself.
          </p>

          <p>
            Following the release of 'B.B.', Rhiannon's debut EP,
            <em>All Things, Rising and Returning</em>, will arrive digitally and
            on vinyl on 25th September via Private Regcords.

          <h3>Artist Statement</h3>
          <div class="quote">
            I feel things are becoming rapidly impersonal and abstract, and so
            with the cover art for All Things, Rising and Returning, I wanted it
            to be as tactile an experience as possible, as a kind of gentle
            rebellion. Everything about the record is physical: it was recorded
            live, the cover art, both single and EP are embroidered by me, the
            songs came together slowly through playing with the band; even most
            of the instruments are acoustic. In a world where media is becoming
            so fast-paced and often short-lived, I want All Things, Rising and
            Returning to act as a break from the need to rush - taking time with
            things should not be underestimated or devalued.

          <h3>About Rhiannon Hope</h3>
          <p>
            Helming from Leeds-via-Liverpool, Rhiannon Hope has quickly found
            her footing in Yorkshire's grassroots scene, collecting a unique
            band of multi-instrumentalists along the way. Together, they create
            textured, jazz-influenced folk soundscapes which act as a bed for
            Rhiannon's bittersweet experiences of womanhood, identity and the
            working class.
          </p>

          <p>
            Somewhere between her unfaltering vibrato and intimate songwriting,
            Hope has earned a loyal following in her adopted city, as well as a
            tour support spot with Gal Go (of King Krule).
          </p>

          <p>
            The songs have been pressed onto wax by Vinyl Press, which will mark
            the first vinyl release both for Rhiannon and for Leeds-based label
            Private Regcords. But the record feels far stronger than most
            debuts, carrying a sense of intention in its songwriting and
            production that most artists only hone much later into their
            discographies.
