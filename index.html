          <h3>About Rhiannon Hope</h3>
          <p>
            Helming from Leeds-via-Liverpool, Rhiannon Hope has quickly found
            her footing in Yorkshire's grassroots scene, collecting a unique
            band of multi-instrumentalists along the way. Together, they create
            textured, jazz-influenced folk soundscapes which act as a bed for
            Rhiannon's bittersweet experiences of womanhood, identity and the
            working class.
          </p>

          <p>
            In the relatively short time the band has been playing together,
            they have garnered a healthy following in Leeds and beyond, and have
            released their debut EP, pressed to vinyl as
            <a href="https://www.instagram.com/privateregcords/" target="_blank"
              >Private Regcords</a
            >' first physical release, to much acclaim; with BBC radio plays for
            singles B.B. and Indulge, and the EP being named one of
            <a

          </p>

          <p>
            Hope &amp; her band also completed a sold out UK headline tour to
            celebrate the release of the EP, including a date at London's
            <a href="https://www.windmillbrixton.co.uk" target="_blank"
              >Brixton Windmill</a
            >
            along the way. Earlier in the year, Hope joined

          </p>

          <p>
            2026 will bring the anticipated release of a live favourite single
            of Rhiannon Hope's, celebrated by a headline show at the Leeds
            institution of
            <a href="https://www.brudenellsocialclub.co.uk" target="_blank"
              >The Brudenell Social Club</a
            >, with plans for the release of a second EP later in the year.

          <h3>About the Single</h3>
          <p>
            Private Regcords sweetheart and local legend Rhiannon Hope returns
            to the Brudenell! In celebration of the release of live favourite
            'Magpie', featuring the dulcet tones of Joseph Barron's saxophone,
            the 30th of April will see Rhiannon Hope and her band headline the
            <a href="https://www.brudenellsocialclub.co.uk" target="_blank"
              >Brudenell Social Club</a
            >.
          </p>

          <p>
            As a single, the almost psychedelic Magpie shows something of a
            contrast to Hope's acclaimed debut EP
            <em>All Things Rising and Returning</em> (which was named one of
            <a
              href="https://faroutmagazine.co.uk/the-15-best-independent-releases-of-2025/"

              >Far Out Magazine</a
            >'s Top 15 Independent Releases of 2025). This isn't to say Hope is
            departing from her unique and well-loved blend of jazz-influenced
            folk, rather the new single, expertly produced by
            <a

              target="_blank"
              >Evan J. Martin</a
            >, seems to show Hope's band showcasing their full potential and
            flexibility as multi-genre musicians. At just over seven minutes of
            bliss, Magpie is undeniable proof that the Rhiannon Hope band is not
            resting on their laurels.

          <h3>Debut EP: All Things, Rising and Returning</h3>
          <p>
            Weaving odes to jazz greats into tales of the working class
            experience and stitching gentle twangs into accordion hums,
            <em>All Things, Rising and Returning</em> marked the debut release
            from Rhiannon Hope in September 2025. The EP nurtures a unique blend
            of traditional folk and contemporary influences, with Rhiannon
            looking to the likes of Ella Fitzgerald and Aldous Harding for sonic
            guidance. The resulting sound is at once delicate and deliberate,
            wistful yet soulful, and, perhaps most of all, timeless.
          </p>
